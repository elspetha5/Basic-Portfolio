            I never wanted to be a teacher. The pay is, in a phrase, not great, the amount of work involved seemed a bit thankless, and to my younger, more pretentious self becoming a teacher felt like I was settling on something easy. But after graduating with a degree in Psychology and not wanting to pursue more of that I found a job as an instructional aid in a Kindergarten classroom and have now spent 10 years of my life working in education. It has changed me. I am a better person because of it. And I strive to live up to the incredibly dedicated colleagues around me.

            Besides working in a field that mostly attracts people who are passionate about what they do, I also fulfilled one of my lifelong goals last year by publishing a book. I took the self-publishing route which turned out to be so creatively satisfying that I don't believe I would want to have done it any other way. I am passionate about the projects I work on. Whether they are for the public eye or just to hang in my house, I take great pride in doing a thing well and adding my own flare to it along the way.
