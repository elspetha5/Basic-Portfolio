        I never wanted to be a teacher. The pay is, in a phrase, not great, the amount of work involved seemed a bit thankless, and to my young ambitious self becoming a teacher felt like I was settling on something easy. But after graduating with a degree in Psychology and not wanting to pursue more of that I found a job as an instructional aid in a Kindergarten classroom and have now spent 10 years of my life working in education.
